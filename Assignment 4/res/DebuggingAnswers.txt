Put the answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1: numDisks = 5, start = 'A', finish = 'C', temp = 'B'



Q2: File: src/Demos/TowewrsOfHanoiGUI.cpp in the function: makeTheMagicHappen



Q3: Number of total moves = 31



Q4: Number of total moves after the first recursion call = 15



Q5: String with two characters (ex: "ab")



Q6: At line 41, in the recursive call, chosen += ch should be replaced by chosen + ch



Q7: Feeding "ab", the output of the bugged function is "aba". Fixing the bug, we have instead
the correct permutation "ba". This is because the += operation changes the value of the variable
'chosen' for the next iteration. In the next recursive call, we end up adding ch='a' to chosen="ab".
